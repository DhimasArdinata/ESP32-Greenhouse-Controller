/**
 * @file SensorDataManager.h
 * @brief Defines the `SensorDataManager` class, a central repository for current environmental
 *        sensor readings (temperature, humidity, light) and their operational thresholds.
 *
 * This file declares the `SensorDataManager` class. Its primary role is to encapsulate
 * and manage the state of various environmental sensors and the corresponding minimum/maximum
 * thresholds that define desired operational ranges. This data is crucial for other system
 * components, such as the `RelayController`, to make control decisions.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Data Storage: Holds public member variables for current temperature (`temperature`),
 *   humidity (`humidity`), and light (`light`) readings. It also stores the configured
 *   minimum and maximum thresholds for each of these: `tempMin`, `tempMax`, `humMin`,
 *   `humMax`, `lightMin`, and `lightMax`.
 * - Initialization: The constructor (`SensorDataManager()`) sets initial default values
 *   for sensor readings (often indicating "not yet read" or a safe default) and thresholds
 *   (representing default operational ranges, possibly overridden later).
 * - Data Update:
 *   - `updateData()`: Allows updating the current sensor readings with new values obtained
 *     from physical sensors.
 *   - `updateThresholds()`: Allows modification of the operational thresholds, likely based
 *     on user configuration or system settings.
 *   Both methods perform basic validation on the input values.
 * - Persistence (`loadFromLog()`): Provides a mechanism to initialize or restore sensor
 *   readings and threshold values by parsing them from the last entry in a log file stored
 *   on an SD card. This allows the system to resume with previously known states.
 *   This functionality relies on `<FS.h>` and `<SD.h>` for file system operations.
 * - Access: Provides getter methods (`getTempMin()`, `getTempMax()`, etc.) for retrieving
 *   the configured thresholds. Current sensor values are accessed directly via public members.
 *
 * This class centralizes sensor-related data, making it easily accessible and manageable
 * throughout the application.
